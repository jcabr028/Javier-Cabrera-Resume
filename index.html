        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current senior at UC Riverside. Iâ€™m studying to get my BA in the field of sociology. Iâ€™m the first born of seven. I was the first person in my family to attend college and in the summer of 2020, I will be the first person to graduate. I started my educational journey in community college in 2015. I started as a biology major, wanting to go into the field of animal medicine. Somewhere along the line I switched my major to sociology to broaden my spectrum of knowledge. This major didnâ€™t change my career path so at the same time I was taking the science courses I needed for veterinary school. While I was there, I was doing community service off campus. This mostly consisted of volunteering at my Church, Corpus Christi. I put in countless hours of service there, helping to organize and facilitate retreats, helping in classrooms, and leading small groups. In the end, I graduated with 3 Associateâ€™s Degrees: Math and Science, Sociology and Criminal Justice.<br><br>

        In 2018 I transferred to UCR. I quickly got involved in organizations that gave back to the community such as UER and Puente Connection. We did things like street clean ups to helping in conferences. My second year I took up a position in both organizations. It was the same position for both, so the responsibilities overlapped. The position was officer of Public Relations. Under this position I was a liaison for multiple councils under which each organization fell under. This required me to relay information back and forth between the councils and the organizations. Another responsibility that I took on was joining a mentorship program where I would be a mentor for an incoming student to UCR. This required me to meet with them once every other week and help them with their transition to the school. Off campus I started volunteering at an animal clinic located at animal shelter. I enjoyed the environment and being able to give back to the community.<br><br>

        After volunteering at the animal shelter, I realized that going into animal medicine wasnâ€™t what I wanted to do. I started looking into law enforcement. I had always liked giving back to the community and what better way to do it than being a police officer. I have always admired that profession for what they do to keep us safe. I would also think that would be great way to be a role model not just to my younger siblings, but also to others with my same background.
